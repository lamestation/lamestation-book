#### Adding A Ball

What's the goal here? We need a ball that will go back and forth on the
screen. There's a few approaches to this, but I find the easiest to do is
using separate speed and position variables.

    
    
        long    x
        long    y
        
        long    speed_x
        long    speed_y

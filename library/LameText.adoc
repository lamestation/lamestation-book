=== About

LameGFX must be started before LameText can be used.

Begin by loading a font into LameText with `txt.Load`, passing the font address, first character, and character width and height. Only one font can be loaded at a time, but fonts can be switched at any time. Changing the width and height of the font changes the spacing of letters.

Now you can use any of the text-drawing commands, keeping in mind that they won't be visible until `lcd.Draw` is called.

=== Font Format

LameStation fonts are regular LameGFX sprites, but organized according to the http://www.asciitable.com/[ASCII table].

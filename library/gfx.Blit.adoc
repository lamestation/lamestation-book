#### gfx.Blit

Copy a screen-sized (128x64) image to the screen.

#####  Syntax

    
    
    Blit(address)

  * ** address ** \- The address of the image you wish to include. Should only be used with a single-frame image, as that's the only one accessible. 

This command returns no value.

#####  Description

Sometimes it is desirable to paste a screen-sized image to the screen, for
testing, backdrops, slideshows, etc. This command is the fastest way to
perform those operations. For any other image size, the Sprite command should
be used.

#####  Example

    
    
    PUB Main
        lcd.Start(gfx.Start)
     
        gfx.Blit(starbackdrop.Addr)
    	lcd.DrawScreen
        
        repeat

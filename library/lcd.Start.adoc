#### lcd.Start

Initialize the LameLCD library.

#####  Syntax

    
    
    Start(buffer)

  * ** buffer ** \- The address of a draw buffer to be copied to the screen. The buffer is a long-aligned contiguous region of memory that is 2048 bytes in size. 

#####  Description

Before LameLCD can be used, it must be initialized. During this
initialization, it must be passed an address to a drawing surface. Normally
this is provided by LameGFX, but it can also be a user-defined buffer provided
that size and alignment match (2048 bytes, long-aligned).

#####  Example

Initialize LameLCD directly with the buffer provided by LameGFX.

    
    
    OBJ
     
    PUB Main
        lcd.Start(gfx.Start)

Save the buffer provided by LameGFX to be used for custom drawing operations,
then pass that address to LameLCD.

    
    
    VAR
        long	buffer
     
    PUB Main
        buffer := gfx.Start
    	lcd.Start(buffer)

Before any object can be used, it must be declared in an OBJ block. It is good
practice to always call declare your objects with the same name.

    
    
    OBJ
    	lcd :	"LameLCD"
    	gfx :	"LameGFX"

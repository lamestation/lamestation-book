LameMusic is a sequencer for LameAudio that allows your games to play music.

[source, language='obj']
----
music : "LameMusic"
----

Demos for this object can be found in the `/demos/music/` folder of the SDK.

=== Commands

- `music.Start` - Start the LameMusic song player core.
- `music.Load` - Load a song to play.
- `music.Play` - Play the current song once.
- `music.Loop` - Play the current song forever.
- `music.IsPlaying` - Return whether a song is currently playing.
- `music.Stop` - Stop the currently playing song.

=== About

[IMPORTANT]
LameAudio must be started before LameMusic.

Call `music.Start` once at the beginning of your program to start the music engine.

To load a song, call `music.Load` using the `Addr` function of the song object as an argument.  Only one song can play at a time. Loading a new song will stop any currently playing one.

music.Load(mycoolsong.Addr)

You can use the `music.Play` command to play a song once, or `music.Loop` to play it forever. Call `music.IsPlaying` to find out if a song is currently playing.

Once you're tired of listening to music, call `music.Stop` to end the song. Playing the song again will start over from the beginning.

=== Song Format

[NOTE]
Software to create LameMusic song objects is planned; for now, songs must be created by hand.

LameStation songs consist of two main sections: pattern and sequence data.

==== Pattern Data

Patterns contain melodies, riffs, harmonies and any musical parts that fit in a measure.

- *Notes per measure* (first byte) (`0-255`) - Each pattern must have exactly this many notes.
- *Note* (`0-127`) - Play note n between 0 and 127.
- *Stop note* (`$83`) - Stop playing note.
- *Do nothing* (`$82`) - Do nothing (continue playing or not playing current note).

==== Sequence Data

The sequence defines how the patterns are arranged in time and across channels. There should be one command, as many times as you want.

- *Pattern* (`<ch1>`, `<ch2>`, `<ch3>`, `<ch4>`) - Set next pattern to pattern 1-127 for all four channels. Pattern 0 plays nothing.
- *End song* (`$80`) - End the song.
- *ADSRW* (`$A0`, `<a>`, `<d>`, `<s>`, `<r>`, `<w>`) - Change the sound of channel(s).
- *Tempo* (`$B0`, `0-255`) - Change the tempo of the song.
- *Transpose* (`$C0`, `-128-127`) - Transpose the channel up or down number of notes.

==== Song Interface

For LameMusic to access the song object, some extra code is needed. This code provides an address which LameMusic reads to figure out where the song data is.

#### lcd.SetFrameLimit

Set an upper limit to the number of times the screen will be redrawn a second.

#####  Syntax

    
    
    SetFrameLimit(frequency)

  * ** frequency ** \- The number of frames per second. Setting to 0 disables frame limiting. 

#####  Description

SetFrameLimit behaves like a speed limit. By setting it, you are allowing
games to run as slow as they want, but no faster than, the set frame rate.

When frame limiting is disabled, [ lcd.DrawScreen
](lcd.DrawScreen_15400984.adoc) does not wait for the vertical syncing period
to update the screen, which may result in tearing. To prevent tearing when
frame limiting is disabled, call the [ lcd.WaitForVerticalSync
](lcd.WaitForVerticalSync_15400983.adoc) function before DrawScreen.

Frame limiting is disabled by default.

#####  Example

Setting the frame limit to ~36Hz after program startup.

    
    
    PUB Main
    	lcd.Start(gfx.Start)
    	lcd.SetFrameLimit(40)

Setting the frame limit to ~17Hz.

    
    
    	lcd.SetFrameLimit(20)

Disabling frame limiting.

    
    
    	lcd.SetFrameLimit(0)

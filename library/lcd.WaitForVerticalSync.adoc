#### lcd.WaitForVerticalSync

Wait until the start of the next LCD frame before continuing.

#####  Syntax

    
    
    WaitForVerticalSync

This command takes no parameters and returns no values.

#####  Description

[ lcd.DrawScreen ](lcd.DrawScreen_15400984.adoc) can be called at any time to
copy the drawing buffer to the display buffer. This is likely to happen when
LameLCD is already updating the physical screen, which will cause the screen
to flicker.

INSERT IMAGE EXPLAINING THIS.

However, there is a brief period at the start of every LCD cycle where there
is no activity. Calling WaitForVerticalSync will force your application to
wait until this period before continuing with execution. By calling it before
[ lcd.DrawScreen ](lcd.DrawScreen_15400984.adoc) , you can achieve a flicker-
free display.

If frame limiting is enabled with [ lcd.SetFrameLimit
](lcd.SetFrameLimit_14811144.adoc) , this command has no effect.

#####  Example

    
    
    PUB Main
    	lcd.Start(gfx.Start)
     
    	repeat
    		' draw lots of stuff!!
    		lcd.WaitForVerticalSync
    		lcd.DrawScreen

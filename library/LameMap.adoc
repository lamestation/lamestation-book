LameMap is an extension to
link:LameGFX.adoc[LameGFX] for tile-based game maps. It is
built on the underlying `gfx.Map` command, but
provides additional informational functionality for managing map data
and testing for map-based collision.

== Commands

- `map.Load` - Load a map into LameMap for drawing to the screen.
- `map.Draw` - Draw the current map to the screen.
- `map.DrawRectangle` - Draw the current map to a portion of the screen.
- `map.Width` - Return the width of the currently loaded map in tiles.
- `map.Height` - Return the height of the currently loaded map in tiles.
- `map.TestCollision` - Test if the region has collided with a map tile.
- `map.TestMoveX` - Apply horizontal movement to an object's position and test if it will collide.
- `map.TestMoveY` - Apply vertical movement to an object's position and test if it will collide.
- `map.TestPoint` - Test whether tile on a map is collidable.

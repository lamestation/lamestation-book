LameMap is an extension to link:LameGFX.adoc[LameGFX] for tile-based game maps. It is
built on the underlying `gfx.Map` command, but provides additional informational functionality for managing map data and testing for map-based collision.

== Commands

- `map.Load` - Load a map into LameMap.
- `map.Draw` - Draw the current map to the screen.
- `map.DrawRectangle` - Draw the current map to a portion of the screen.
- `map.Width` - Return the width of the currently loaded map in tiles.
- `map.Height` - Return the height of the currently loaded map in tiles.
- `map.TestPoint` - Test whether tile on a map is collidable.
- `map.TestCollision` - Test if the region has collided with a map tile.
- `map.TestMoveX` - Apply horizontal movement to an object's position and test if it will collide.
- `map.TestMoveY` - Apply vertical movement to an object's position and test if it will collide.

== About

LameGFX must be started before LameMap can be used. Call `map.Load` to load a map. Only one map can be loaded at a time.

There are two ways to draw a map to the screen: `map.Draw` draws the map to the whole screen, while `map.DrawRectangle` draws it to a region with the corners (x1, y1) and (x2, y2). Both require an `offset_x` and `offset_y` that determine which portion of the map to show.

You can get the number of horizontal and vertical tiles in your map with `map.Width` and `map.Height`.

LameMap has collision support built in.

=== Tilemaps

Each game map requires a tile map, and an optional collision map.

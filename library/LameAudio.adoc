LameAudio is a 4-channel synthesizer for the LameStation.

[source, language='obj']
----
audio : "LameAudio"
----

Demos for this object can be found in the `/demos/audio/` folder of the SDK.

=== Commands

- `audio.Start` - Initialize the LameAudio synthesizer.
- `audio.SetEnvelope` - Toggle the ADSR envelope generator on the given audio channel.
- `audio.StopAllSound` - Stop sound on all channels.

*Sound Shaping Commands*

- `audio.SetParam` - Manually set a parameter of the audio channel.
- `audio.SetADSR` - Set all parameters of the ADSR envelope shape.
- `audio.SetWaveform` - Set the waveform of the given audio channel.
- `audio.SetSample` - Load a new sample.
- `audio.LoadPatch` - Load a complete patch configuration to any channel(s).

*Keyboard Mode Commands*

- `audio.PlaySound` - Play a sound on the specified channel.
- `audio.StopSound` - Stop sound on the specified channel.

*Manual Mode Commands*

- `audio.SetVolume` - Set the volume of the target note.
- `audio.SetNote` - Set the note of the given audio channel.
- `audio.SetFrequency` - Set the frequency increment of the specified audio channel.
- `audio.StartEnvelope` - Trigger the channel envelope to start.
- `audio.StopEnvelope` - Trigger the channel envelope to stop.

=== Constants

- *Waveform* - `_SQUARE`, `_SAW`, `_TRIANGLE`, `_SINE`, `_NOISE`, `_SAMPLE`
- *Channel parameter* - `_ATK`, `_DEC`, `_SUS`, `_REL`, `_WAV`, `_CONTROL`

=== About

Before LameAudio can be used, `audio.Start` must be called once and only once at the start of a program. LameAudio is designed so that only one synthesizer is ever running, and any object may call it.

Each channel has its own parameters that affect the sound it makes. `audio.SetParam` can control any parameter in the _Channel parameter_ constant list. You can change all parameters at once with the `audio.LoadPatch` command, which is good if you change instruments often.

This is what a patch looks like.

Each channel has a waveform and an envelope.

==== Waveform

The waveform generator is what actually creates the sound. Call `audio.SetFrequency` to play any frequency, or call `audio.SetNote` to play specific notes like on a piano.

Call `audio.SetWaveform` to load one of the following waveforms.

.Waveforms

| *Value* | *Name*   | *Waveform*
| 0       | Square   | image:0_square.png[]
| 1       | Sawtooth | image:1_saw.png[]

| 4       | Noise    | image:4_noise.png[]

|===

The _Sample_ waveform is a 512B block of audio data, enough for one cycle. Call `audio.SetSample` with the address of a sample to load it. Only one sample can be used at a time.

A collection of ready-made samples can be found in the `/media/samples/` folder of the SDK.

==== Envelope

The envelope controls the volume of the sound over time, allowing you to create sounds that hit sharply like bells, or have a long hold time like a wind instrument. You can control how it sounds with the ADSR parameters of the envelope.

_ADSR_ stands for _Attack, Decay, Sustain, and Release_. You can configure ADSR settings with `audio.SetADSR`.

image:adsr.png[]

- *Attack* (`0-127`) - The time from silence to full volume.
- *Decay* (`0-127`) - The time from the max value to...
- *Sustain* (`0-127`) - The volume at which the note is held while pressed.
- *Release* (`0-127`) - The time from sustain to silence.

The envelope can be toggled with `audio.SetEnvelope`.

- If enabled, you can play and stop notes with the `audio.PlaySound` and `audio.StopSound` commands.

- If disabled, you can control channel volume manually using `audio.SetVolume`, which is useful for creating sound effects. You can also manually start and stop the envelope with `audio.StartEnvelope` and `audio.StopEnvelope`.

To silence all audio, use the `audio.StopAllSound` command.

=== Sample Format

LameStation songs consist of two main sections: pattern and sequence data.

==== Sample Data

A LameAudio sample is a 512-byte sequence of arbitrary data. It can be anything you want as long as its 512 bytes.

Since it's possible to use any address in memory, the running system can also create samples on the fly.

==== Sample Interface

The address of sample data can be passed directly to `audio.SetSample`, unless stored in another object. If so, use this interface:

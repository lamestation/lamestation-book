== Commands

- `gfx.Start` - Initialize the LameGFX drawing library.
- `gfx.Clear` - Clear the screen to black.
- `gfx.Fill` - Fill the screen with a repeating word `color`.
- `gfx.Blit` - Draw a screen-sized image at (0,0).
- `gfx.Sprite` - Draw an image of any size to (x,y).
- `gfx.Map` - Draw a tile-based level map.
- `gfx.InvertColor` - Invert black and white pixels sprite drawing.
- `gfx.SetClipRectangle` - Change the portion of the screen that will be drawn to by LameGFX.
- `gfx.WaitToDraw` - Wait until the last drawing operation has completed before continuing.

== Constants

- `BLACK`, `GRAY`, `WHITE`, `TRANSPARENT` - predefined colors for filling the screen with `gfx.Fill`.
- `SCREEN_W`, `SCREEN_H` - the width and height of the screen.

== About

Call `gfx.Start` to start LameGFX. It should only be started once at the beginning of your program, before all drawing operations.

Clear the screen to black with `gfx.Clear`, or fill to any color with `gfx.Fill`.

Call `gfx.Sprite` to draw images to the screen. If an image is exactly 128x64 pixels, use `gfx.Blit` for much faster drawing.

Use `gfx.Map` to draw level maps directly, or you can use LameMap for more functionality.

`gfx.InvertColor` changes all black pixels to white, and vice versa. This is useful as a cool effect or reusing graphics.

Sometimes you may need to wait until a drawing operations has completed before continuing

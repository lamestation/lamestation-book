#### map.TestMoveY

Apply vertical movement to an object's position and test if it will collide.

#####  Syntax

    
    
    TestMoveY(oldx, oldy, w, h, newy)

  * ** oldx ** \- x position of object 
  * ** oldy ** \- y position of object 
  * ** w ** \- width of object 
  * ** h ** \- height of object 
  * ** newy ** \- proposed new y position of object 

#####  Description

Returns a non-zero adjustment value if a collision has occurred for the object
and the map at the proposed new vertical position; 0 otherwise. With the
adjustment applied to the new position it is guaranteed that the object now
lines up with the obstacle.

Important

This function performs a single object location check at ( ** oldx ** , **
newy ** ). This means that if the distance between ** oldy ** and ** newy **
is sufficiently large it may miss potential map collisions (e.g. halfway
between ** oldy ** and ** newy ** ).

#####  Example

    
    
    PUB Main
        lcd.Start(gfx.Start)                         ' setup screen and renderer
        map.Load(@gfx_data, @map_data)               ' prepare map
    
        repeat
            ' If there is no collision TestMoveY returns 0 so newx
            ' isn't affected. Otherwise the adjustment is applied.
            newy += map.TestMoveY(oldx, oldy, w, h, newy)
            ' ...
            lcd.DrawScreen                           ' update when ready

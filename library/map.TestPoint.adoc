#### map.TestPoint

Test whether tile on a map is collidable.

#####  Syntax

    
    
    TestPoint(x, y)

  * ** x ** \- Horizontal index of tile on map. 
  * ** y ** -Â Vertical index of tile on map. 

This function returns 0 is tile is walkable, and 1 if it is not.

#####  Description

` TestPoint ` tests whether a specific tile is collidable.

If a tile is collidable, commands like TestMoveX/Y will detect a collision
when the given object coordinates overlap with said tile. This is how
level/wall boundaries are enforced in a tile-based LameStation game.

This command is useful when your game implements its own collision scheme
different from the one included in LameMap.

#####  Example

This example code is taken from [ Pikemanz
](https://lamestation.atlassian.net/wiki/display/PIKE) . The Pikemanz player
does not walk freely on the map, instead moving from square to square on a
grid. [ map.TestCollision ](map.TestCollision_14286906.adoc) is a poor
solution because individual movements are planned then executed, and it must
be known in advance that a tile is walkable before the player moves there. In
this situation, TestPoint is a better solution.

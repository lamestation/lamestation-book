== LameFunctions

LameFunctions holds a few functions that don't really fit anywhere else.

[source, language='obj']

fn : "LameFunctions"

=== Commands

- `fn.Sleep` - Wait the specified number of milliseconds before continuing.
- `fn.TestBoxCollision` - Test if two rectangular regions of the screen overlap.

=== About

==== fn.Sleep(milliseconds)

Sometimes you need a time delay in your program, and calling `repeat 20000` just isn't good enough. `fn.Sleep` lets you pause for a specified time with millisecond accuracy.

==== fn.TestBoxCollision(x1, y1, w1, h1, x2, y2, w2, h2)

Test if two rectangles on the screen overlap. If you want two objects the screen to interact with each other, you might need this.

For a working example, try `demos/collision/TestBoxCollision.spin` in the LameStation SDK.

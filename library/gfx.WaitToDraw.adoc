#### gfx.WaitToDraw

Wait until the last drawing operation has completed before continuing.

#####  Syntax

    
    
    WaitToDraw

This command takes no arguments, and returns no values.

#####  Description

LameGFX function calls are generally ** non-blocking* ** ; that is, after
starting a graphics drawing operation, your program is allowed to continue
execution before the call has finished. Sometimes, the user may want to create
a custom drawing command for an application. For drawing to begin, he or she
must be certain that the frame buffer is available for drawing.

` WaitToDraw ` forces your program to wait until drawing is complete before
continuing, so you can safely begin a drawing operation.

*It does take time for drawing to finish, so multiple back-to-back drawing calls will start to see a blocking effect. 

#####  Example

Create a custom drawing operation for your game.

    
    
    VAR
    	word   buffer
     
    PUB HighFalootingDrawingOperation(buffer)
    	' some amazing drawing operation
     
    PUB Main
    	buffer := gfx.Start
    	lcd.Start(buffer)
     
    	gfx.WaitToDraw
    	HighFalootingDrawingOperation(buffer)
     
    	lcd.DrawScreen

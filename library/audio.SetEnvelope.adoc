#####  Syntax

#####  Description

LameAudio supports two main modes of operation: the envelope generator can be
enabled or disabled.

When enabled, the channel behaves more like a piano keyboard allowing the
programmer to use the PlaySound and StopSound commands to generate sound.

When disabled, the channel frequency must be controlled via programming, which
allows much more flexibility in what sounds can be created.

#####  Example

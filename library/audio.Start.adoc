#### audio.Start

Initialize the LameAudio synthesizer.

#####  Syntax

    
    
    Start

This command takes no arguments and returns no result.

#####  Description

LameAudio is a standalone 4-oscillator synthesizer that runs in its own
processor core.

** ` Start ` should only be run once ** throughout the duration of a program, otherwise multiple synthesizers will be competing for a single register bank resulting in an undefined state. 

LameAudio however can be included in as many objects as necessary allowing for
convenient code organization.

#####  Example

    
    
    CON
        _clkmode        = xtal1 + pll16x
        _xinfreq        = 5_000_000
    
    OBJ
        audio   :               "LameAudio"
    
    PUB Noise
        audio.Start
        audio.SetWaveform(1, 4)

#### map.DrawRectangle

Draw the current map to a portion of the screen.

#####  Syntax

    
    
    DrawRectangle(offset_x, offset_y, x1, y1, x2, y2)

  * ** xoffset ** \- Starting x position on map. 
  * ** yoffset ** \- Starting y position on map. 
  * ** x1 ** \- Left edge of clip rectangle. 
  * ** y1 ** \- Top edge of clip rectangle. 
  * ** x2 ** \- Right edge of clip rectangle. 
  * ** y2 ** \- Bottom edge of clip rectangle. 

#####  Description

Draw a region of the current map loaded by ` Load ` , starting at ` (xoffset,
yoffset) ` , to screen, in a region of the screen defined by ` (x1, y1, x2,
y2) ` .

Each tile in a level map is one byte, with 1 bit for collision and 7 bits for
tilemap index. This means that ** tilemaps are limited to 128 different tiles
** per map.

xoffset and yoffset select a starting point on the level map from which to
draw the screen from. This is how you control which part of the level to
display.

` DrawRectangle ` is more powerful than ` DrawMap ` as it allows you to
customize the size of the map region that is drawn to the screen. This is
useful for creating games with multiple screens views, or using ` DrawMap ` to
create tile-based non-level game assets like enemy spaceships.

    PUB Main
        lcd.Start(gfx.Start)                         ' setup screen and renderer
        map.Load(@gfx_data, @map_data)               ' prepare map
    
        repeat
            ' ...
            gfx.ClearScreen                          ' clear screen (map may be transparent)
            map.DrawRectangle(offsetx, offsety, 20, 20, 100, 64)    ' draw map
            ' ...
            ' ...
            lcd.DrawScreen                           ' update when ready

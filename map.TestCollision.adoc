#### map.TestCollision

Test if the region has collided with a map tile.

#####  Syntax

    
    
    TestCollision(x, y, w, h)

  * ** x ** \- x position of object 
  * ** y ** \- y position of object 
  * ** w ** \- width of object 
  * ** h ** \- height of object 

Returns non-zero  1  if a collision has occurred between an object and the
map; 0 otherwise.

#####  Description

All LameStation tilemaps are embedded with collision information, so that
levels created through the map editor already have walkable regions defined
when loaded. This command tests an object against those walkable areas.

Off-Map Regions

Only valid map regions are tested for collisions; positions that are off the
map area will always return 0.

1  The exact value is the coordinate pair of the first map tile causing a
collision, offset by (1, 1).

#### Transparency

There's one other "color" that you can use, if you want to call it that.
Here's what a block of  _ transparency _ looks in the sprite format.

    
    
    word    %%22222222
    word    %%22222222
    word    %%22222222
    word    %%22222222
    word    %%22222222
    word    %%22222222
    word    %%22222222
    word    %%22222222

We won't even bother trying to run it though because, well... you won't be
able to see it!

#######  How Does It Work?

If you were paying attention to the explanation of color bits and flip bits (I
can understand if you weren't), you may have noticed something interesting. If
00 equals black, 01 equals white, and 11 equals gray, what does 10 equal? What
happens when the flip bit is enabled but the color is off?

Well, nothing happens, and it wouldn't make sense if something did. So we
decided to do something useful with that extra "color", and use it for
transparency. The best way to show what this draws is by showing what it
doesn't draw.

Here is a drawing of a ball on top of a square.

** BallWithoutTransparency.spin **
    
    
    CON
        _clkmode = xtal1|pll16x
        _xinfreq = 5_000_000
    
    OBJ
        lcd : "LameLCD"
        gfx : "LameGFX"
        
    PUB Main
        lcd.Start(gfx.Start)
        gfx.Sprite(@box, 40, 20, 0)
        gfx.Sprite(@ball, 42, 22, 0)
        lcd.DrawScreen
    
    DAT
    
    box
    word    0
    word    8, 8
    word    %%33333333
    word    %%33333333
    word    %%33333333
    word    %%33333333
    word    %%33333333
    word    %%33333333
    word    %%33333333
    word    %%33333333
    
    ball
    word    0
    word    8, 8
    word    %%00000000
    word    %%00011000
    word    %%00111100
    word    %%01111110
    word    %%01111110
    word    %%00111100
    word    %%00011000
    word    %%00000000

Here's what it looks like. The first thing you notice is that the ball
completely obstructs the square.

Here is the same example again, but with the ball image modified to use
transparency.

** BallWithTransparency.spin **
    
    
    CON
        _clkmode = xtal1|pll16x
        _xinfreq = 5_000_000
    
    OBJ
        lcd : "LameLCD"
        gfx : "LameGFX"
        
    PUB Main
        lcd.Start(gfx.Start)
        gfx.Sprite(@box, 40, 20, 0)
        gfx.Sprite(@ball, 42, 22, 0)
        lcd.DrawScreen
    
    DAT
    
    box
    word    0
    word    8, 8
    word    %%33333333
    word    %%33333333
    word    %%33333333
    word    %%33333333
    word    %%33333333
    word    %%33333333
    word    %%33333333
    word    %%33333333
    
    ball
    word    0
    word    8, 8
    word    %%22222222
    word    %%22211222
    word    %%22111122
    word    %%21111112
    word    %%21111112
    word    %%22111122
    word    %%22211222
    word    %%22222222

Now it actually looks like a ball in front of a square instead of a random
square thing in front of a square.

And voila, that's transparency!

Think It Over

_ Question 1: How does LameGFX actually _ draw _ transparent pixels? How does
this work? _

When LameGFX encounters a transparent picture, it simply ignores it. There's
no drawing involved.

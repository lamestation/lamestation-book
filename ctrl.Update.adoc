#### ctrl.Update

Update the state of all LameStation controls.

#####  Syntax

    
    
    Update

This command takes no parameters, and returns 0 or 1.

#####  Description

The state of the Propeller pins can change at any time, regardless of the
state of your application. Since you are likely to want to check the value of
a command multiple times in a program, LameControl saves the state of the
Propeller pins to another register, which are then returned by the various
commands. This means that the value returned is guaranteed to be the same
until another call to ` Update ` .

` Update ` must be called before attempting to retrieve control states.

#####  Example

    
    
    PUB Main
        ctrl.Start
     
        repeat
            ctrl.Update
            ' ...
     
            if ctrl.A
                ' ...
     
            if ctrl.A
                ' ...
     
            ' ...

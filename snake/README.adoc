= Snake

In this tutorial, we're going to be making a totally epic game where you are a hungry, hungry snake trying to find its way in this world. First dreamed up in 1976, snake games saw wider popularity when it came pre-installed on some cell phones.

In the game, you eat start out as a single dot, with food pellets randomly appearing on the screen. Naturally, you chow down, but the problem is that as you eat them, you grow longer and longer, making it harder to get around without accidentally eating yourself.

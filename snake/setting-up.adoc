== Setting Up
:experimental:

In this section, we lay down the basic code needed to create a LameStation game.

=== Instructions

==== Using Templates

To begin this tutorial, we'll start with the LameStation Basic template. In PropellerIDE, you can create a new project from a template with kbd:[Ctrl+Shift+T].

Once created, save the template as `Snake.spin`, and make sure you save it somewhere you can find it again.

[source]
.Snake.spin
----
CON
    _clkmode = xtal1 + pll16x
    _xinfreq = 5_000_000

OBJ
    lcd  : "LameLCD"
    gfx  : "LameGFX"
    ctrl : "LameControl"

PUB Main
    lcd.Start(gfx.Start)
    ctrl.Start
    
    ' add your code here
----

==== What's Inside?

This template adds some basic code to get a LameStation game started. Let's look at what's inside:

- The `CON` block contains code to tell the LameStation to run at full speed.

----
CON
    _clkmode = xtal1 + pll16x
    _xinfreq = 5_000_000
----

- The `OBJ` block adds three libraries needed for this project: LameGFX and LameLCD for graphics, and LameControl for user input.

----
OBJ
    lcd  : "LameLCD"
    gfx  : "LameGFX"
    ctrl : "LameControl"
----

- The `PUB Main` block starts the libraries.
+
[source]
----
PUB Main
    lcd.Start(gfx.Start)
    ctrl.Start
    
    ' add your code here
----
+
[TIP]
====
The first function in your file is where your code will start when run. It doesn't have to be called `Main`, but it does have to be first.
====

You will find this code used a lot in almost every game, which is why we're using a template to create it.

*NEXT TIME: You will see the snake finally come to life... as a dot.*

=== The Code

[source]
.Snake.spin
----
CON
    _clkmode = xtal1 + pll16x
    _xinfreq = 5_000_000

OBJ
    lcd  : "LameLCD"
    gfx  : "LameGFX"
    ctrl : "LameControl"

PUB Main
    lcd.Start(gfx.Start)
    ctrl.Start
----

=== Recap

In this section, you learned how to:

- Create Spin files from templates
- Set up graphics for a LameStation project

=== Think about this!

- What does LameLCD do? What does LameGFX do?

==== Using Templates

To begin this tutorial, we'll start with the LameStation Basic template. In PropellerIDE, you can create a new project from a template with kbd:[Ctrl+Shift+T].

Once created, save the template as `Snake.spin`, and make sure you save it somewhere you can find it again.

CON
    _clkmode = xtal1 + pll16x
    _xinfreq = 5_000_000

OBJ
    lcd  : "LameLCD"
    gfx  : "LameGFX"
    ctrl : "LameControl"

PUB Main
    lcd.Start(gfx.Start)
    ctrl.Start
    
    ' add your code here

==== What's Inside?

This template adds some basic code to get a LameStation game started. Let's look at what's inside:

- The `CON` block tells the LameStation to run at full speed.

CON
    _clkmode = xtal1 + pll16x
    _xinfreq = 5_000_000

- The `OBJ` block adds three libraries needed for this project: LameGFX and LameLCD for graphics, and LameControl for user input.

OBJ
    lcd  : "LameLCD"
    gfx  : "LameGFX"
    ctrl : "LameControl"

- The `Main` function sets up libraries and provides a basic game skeleton.

PUB Main
    lcd.Start(gfx.Start)
    ctrl.Start
    
    ' add your code here
----

[TIP]
====
The first function in your file is where your code will start when run. It doesn't have to be called `Main`, but it does have to be first.

[NOTE]
`' add your code here` is a line comment and can be removed.

You will find this code used a lot in almost every game, which is why we're using a template to create it.

*NEXT TIME: You will see the snake finally come to life... as a dot.*

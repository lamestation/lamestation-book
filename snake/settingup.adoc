== Setting Up
:experimental:

To begin this tutorial, we'll start with the LameStation Basic template. In PropellerIDE, you can create a new project from a template with kbd:[Ctrl+Shift+T].

This template comes with several goodies already set up.

- The `CON` block tells the LameStation to run at full speed.
+
----
&&&CON
    _clkmode = xtal1 + pll16x
    _xinfreq = 5_000_000
----

- The `OBJ` block adds three libraries needed for this project: LameGFX and LameLCD for graphics, and LameControl for user input.
+
----
OBJ
    lcd  : "LameLCD"
    gfx  : "LameGFX"
    ctrl : "LameControl"
----

- The `Main` function that sets up libraries and provides a basic game skeleton.
+
----
PUB Main
    lcd.Start(gfx.Start)
    ctrl.Start
    
    ' add your code here
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
As you add to this program, the `Main` function should always be _first_! Otherwise, your program won't run.
====

You will find there's certain code you use in almost every LameStation game, which makes these templates pretty useful.

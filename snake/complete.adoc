== Going Further

We have now completed the game!

You can play the officially finished version at `/tutorials/Snake/Snake.spin`.

There's clearly a lot more that could be done. You could add:

- Walls to crash into
- Fancier graphics
- Score keeping
- A snake that goes faster over time
- Obstacles and enemies that come after you
- Powerups
- Levels

There's all kinds of stuff you can do. How would you extend it?

#### LameGFX and LameLCD

Using the LameStation LCD requires two objects: LameLCD and LameGFX.

    
    
    OBJ
        lcd : "LameLCD"
        gfx : "LameGFX"

  * ** [ LameLCD ](LameLCD_13762612.adoc) ** provides a surface for us to draw on that displays on the screen. 
  * ** [ LameGFX ](LameGFX_21725389.adoc) ** provides software drawing functions for creating different kinds of images on the screen. 

Think of it like this: LameLCD provides you with a piece of paper, and LameGFX
provides you with various pens and pencils to draw with. If you want to draw
something in real life, you need both a pen and a paper to do it. That's why
you should always include these two objects together.

Before you can do any drawing, you must start these objects, ideally at the
very beginning of your main function, before anything else. Here's how:

    
    
    PUB Main
        lcd.Start(gfx.Start)

Okay, so it's not quite a pen and paper. LameGFX is more like a pen _ and _
paper, and once it's done drawing, it hands it to LameLCD to hang up on the
fridge (the LCD).

There's one more command to call before you'll see anything on the screen. [
lcd.DrawScreen ](lcd.DrawScreen_15400984.adoc) is the command that hangs the
paper on the fridge.

    
    
        lcd.DrawScreen

Pro Tip

The following is the minimum code needed to initialize and show graphics.

    
    
    OBJ
        lcd : "LameLCD"
        gfx : "LameGFX"
     
    PUB Main
        lcd.Start(gfx.Start)
     
        ' draw stuff here
     
        lcd.DrawScreen

However, when you run this, you still won't see anything, because you actually
have to draw an image for it to appear on the LCD.

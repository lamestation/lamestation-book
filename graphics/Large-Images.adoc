#### Large Images

Unless you're really into tiny 8x8 pixel images, you're probably already sick
of them and want to move on to something bigger. Well, I hear you, so let's
make a larger image.

Creating larger sprites is fairly easy in theory, but in practice, you'll
discover pretty quickly where the difficulty is. Let's make a friendly happy
face as an example.

    OBJ
        lcd : "LameLCD"
        gfx : "LameGFX"
    
    PUB Main
        lcd.Start(gfx.Start)
        gfx.Sprite(@data, 56, 24, 0)
        lcd.Draw
    
    DAT
    
    data
    word    0
    word    16, 16
    word    %%00000111, %%11100000
    word    %%00011111, %%11111000
    word    %%00111111, %%11111100
    word    %%01110011, %%11001110
    word    %%01101101, %%10110110
    word    %%11111111, %%11111111
    word    %%11111111, %%11111111
    word    %%11111111, %%11111111
    
    word    %%11111111, %%11111111
    word    %%11111111, %%11111111
    word    %%11101111, %%11110111
    word    %%01110111, %%11101110
    word    %%01111000, %%00011110
    word    %%00111111, %%11111100
    word    %%00011111, %%11111000
    word    %%00000111, %%11100000

Figured out the first problem yet? ** That took forever for me to draw. Like,
a really, really long time. ** Not only that, but let's look at it.

** I DREW IT BACKWARDS! ** How long will that take to fix? I have to go back and painstakingly change all of the pixels one by one.

Running it again...

Ah, that's much better. Certainly, though, there must be a better way to do
this. This image is only 16x16. What if I want to draw an image that takes up
the whole screen? This is a terribly slow way to do it. There are better ways
which we will learn about in a later section.

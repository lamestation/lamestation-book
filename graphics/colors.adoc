= Colors

So far you've been introduced to black and white, but there are two other colors you can work with that are very important.

== The Color Gray

LameStation supports two more color choices other than plain black and white:
the first of these is gray.

===  Increasing the clock speed

Up until now, you've only been using the LameStation at a reduced speed. As it
turns out, it can go much faster, and you're gonna need to crank it up in
order to use the gray feature.

Adding this code to the beginning of your file tells the Propeller to use the
external crystal oscillator ( [ remember when we installed that?
](15958288.adoc) ) and how fast it should run.

    
    
    CON
        _clkmode = xtal1|pll16x
        _xinfreq = 5_000_000

===  Enabling gray pixels

Here's how to write a block of gray in the LameStation sprite format.

    
    
    word    %%33333333
    word    %%33333333
    word    %%33333333
    word    %%33333333
    word    %%33333333
    word    %%33333333
    word    %%33333333
    word    %%33333333

You may be wondering why the pixels suddenly consist of 3s. This has more to
do with how the LameStation works than anything else.

The LameStation has a black and white screen, so it takes some trickery to get
it to show gray. There are 16 bits for every 8 pixels, but so far, we've only
used about half of them.

    
    
    %%11111111 == %01_01_01_01_01_01_01_01

Here's what the two bits in every pixel do:

  * The 1s here are what we call the "color" bits. They tell the LameStation whether or not a pixel should turn on ever. 
  * The 0s here are the "flip" bits. They tell the LameStation that if a pixel is on, keep it off half the time. 

That means if a pixel's color bit and flip bit are turned on, it will
continuously turn on and off, which appears gray to the human eye. How cool is
that!

See it in action.

Beware

Make sure you check the [ contrast knob ](16547914.adoc) settings! If it's set
too low or too high, the gray color may end up appearing black or white. If
it's set just right, you will get the gray you're looking for.

Since gray can be hard to see by itself, let's see it alongside black and
white to make it more visible.

Think It Over

_ Question 1: What would happen if we tried running the previous example **
without ** increasing the clock speed? _

![](images/icons/grey_arrow_down.png) Click here to show the answer...

Instead of gray, you'll be looking at a blinking white box. Gray is enabled,
but the processor is running far too slowly to drive the LCD and produce the
gray effect.

That's why, in general, you're _ ** always ** _ going to want to run the
LameStation at full speed off the external oscillator. It's literally
thousands of times faster than the internal oscillator and gives you the power
to run real games with real performance.

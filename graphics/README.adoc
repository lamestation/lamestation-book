### Graphics

LameStation graphics are built around sprites.Â What is a sprite?

A sprite is a smaller image that can make up a larger scene. So when you're
playing say, Sonic the Hedgehog, you can see palm tree images, waterfall
images, ground images, wall images, enemy images, etc. All of these things and
more are sprites, and make up the game.

The LameStation has it's own format for storing graphics that you will need to
use to draw with [ LameGFX ](LameGFX_21725389.adoc) . In this section, we walk
you through understanding how to create images that LameGFX can read and draw.

The examples in this section can be found in ` "demos/graphics/" ` of the
LameStation SDK.

= Graphics

LameStation graphics are built around sprites, but what on earth are those?

A sprite is an image that is drawn to the screen as a single piece. So in a game, if you have a palm tree or a hamster or donkey, those are all sprites.

LameStation has its own format for storing sprites that we will learn in the following exercises.

The examples in this section can be found in ` "demos/graphics/" ` of the
LameStation SDK.

== LameGFX and LameLCD

Using the LameStation LCD requires two objects: link:../library/LameLCD.adoc[LameLCD] and link:../library/LameGFX.adoc[LameGFX].

- LameGFX provides functions for drawing different kinds of things.
- LameLCD takes your drawing and outputs it to the actual display.

LameLCD is like a piece of paper, and LameGFX is the pen; you can't use one without the other, so you must always include both.

----
OBJ
    lcd : "LameLCD"
    gfx : "LameGFX"
----

Before any drawing, you must start them, idea. This one line of code configures LameLCD to display what LameGFX is drawing.

----
PUB Main
    lcd.Start(gfx.Start)
----

Now, you can draw to your heart's content, but after drawing, you have to call `lcd.Draw` before you'll actually see anything.

----
    lcd.Draw
----

.Remember This
****
The following is the minimum code needed to initialize and show graphics.

----
OBJ
    lcd : "LameLCD"
    gfx : "LameGFX"

PUB Main
    lcd.Start(gfx.Start)

    ' draw stuff here

    lcd.Draw
----

However, when you run this, you still won't see anything, because you actually
have to draw an image for it to appear on the LCD.

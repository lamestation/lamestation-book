#### Lines

If we want to make anything larger than a pixel, we need to know a little more
about the [ Sprite Format ](Sprite-Format_35749999.adoc) . The sprite format
is divided into two parts: the header and the image.

    
    
    word    0                  ' | header
    word    1, 1               ' |
    word    1                  ' | image

The header is three words long, and contains three values: the ** frameboost
** , the ** width ** , and the ** height ** of the image. For now, **
frameboost ** is always set to zero because we're not using it yet.

    
    
    word    [frameboost]
    word    [width], [height]

#####  A Horizontal Line

If we want to create a horizontal line, we need to put multiple pixels into a
word. You can do this with the '%%' operator.

** Line.spin **
    
    
    OBJ
        lcd : "LameLCD"
        gfx : "LameGFX"
    
    PUB Main
        lcd.Start(gfx.Start)
        
        gfx.Sprite(@data, 0, 0, 0)
        lcd.DrawScreen
    
    DAT
    
    data
    word    0
    word    8, 1
    word    %%11111111

#####  A Long Line

The maximum number of pixels that can be held in a word is 8, so if you want
your line to be any longer, you have to use another word.

** LongLine.spin **
    
    
    OBJ
        lcd : "LameLCD"
        gfx : "LameGFX"
    
    PUB Main
        lcd.Start(gfx.Start)
        
        gfx.Sprite(@data, 0, 30, 0)
        lcd.DrawScreen
    
    DAT
    
    data
    word    0
    word    16, 1
    word    %%11111111, %%11111111

#####  A Vertical Line

We can make vertical lines too. To do that, we'll need to increase the number
of pixels in the drawing. This is done by increasing the number of rows, one
pixel per row.

** VerticalLine.spin **
    
    
    OBJ
        lcd : "LameLCD"
        gfx : "LameGFX"
    
    PUB Main
        lcd.Start(gfx.Start)
    
        gfx.Sprite(@data, 0, 0, 0)
        lcd.DrawScreen
    
    DAT
    
    data
    word    0
    word    1, 12
    
    word    %%1
    word    %%1
    word    %%1
    word    %%1
    
    word    %%1
    word    %%1
    word    %%1
    word    %%1
    
    word    %%1
    word    %%1
    word    %%1
    word    %%1

Think It Over

_ Question 1: _ _ How would you increase the thickness of a horizontal line? A
vertical line? _

![](images/icons/grey_arrow_down.png) Click here to show the answer...

It's easy! Simply combine what you've learned about making a line longer in
both directions.

** ThickLines.spin **
    
    
    OBJ
        lcd : "LameLCD"
        gfx : "LameGFX"
    
    PUB Main
        lcd.Start(gfx.Start)
        gfx.Sprite(@line1, 32, 24, 0)
        gfx.Sprite(@line2, 90, 24, 0)
        lcd.DrawScreen
    
    DAT
    
    line1
    word    0
    word    24, 2
    word    %%11111111, %%11111111, %%11111111
    word    %%11111111, %%11111111, %%11111111
    
    line2
    word    0
    word    2, 16
    word    %%11
    word    %%11
    word    %%11
    word    %%11
    word    %%11
    word    %%11
    word    %%11
    word    %%11
    
    word    %%11
    word    %%11
    word    %%11
    word    %%11
    word    %%11
    word    %%11
    word    %%11
    word    %%11

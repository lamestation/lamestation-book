= A Pixel

Here is the most image we can draw to the screen: a single pixel. We will store the image in a `DAT` block, which allows you to store any kind of data you want. We'll do this by creating the block, adding the image data, and assigning the label "data" to it, so that we can refer to it by name in our program.

Here is what our completed pixel looks like in LameStation sprite format.

----
DAT

data

word    0
word    1, 1
word    1
----

Now we will need the the [ gfx.Sprite ](gfx.Sprite_15958162.adoc) command.
This command has _ parameters _ , which are values passed into a function that
change the output.

----
gfx.Sprite(source, x, y, frame)
----

We can draw the pixel by passing in the name of the label prefixed with '@' as
the ** source ** parameter. We don't need the rest of the parameters for now,
so set them to 0.

.Pixel.spin
----
OBJ
    lcd : "LameLCD"
    gfx : "LameGFX"

PUB Main
    lcd.Start(gfx.Start)

    gfx.Sprite(@data, 0, 0, 0)
    lcd.DrawScreen

DAT

data
word    0
word    1, 1
word    1

image:Pixel.png[]

Well, that's boring. You can hardly see where it ended up! In the next
example, we'll put pixels somewhere else on the screen and make them unboring!

.Think It Over
****
_Question 1: What will happen if you pass nothing into the link:../library/gfx.Sprite.adoc[`gfx.Sprite`] command? What will it do?_

----    
gfx.Sprite(0, 0, 0, 0)
----

See for yourself! Try the following example.

.Nothing.spin
----
OBJ
    lcd : "LameLCD"
    gfx : "LameGFX"

PUB Main
    lcd.Start(gfx.Start)
    gfx.Sprite(0, 0, 0, 0)
    lcd.DrawScreen
----

Here's what you'll get.

image:Nothing.spin[]

The LameStation libraries do not check to make sure that your inputs are
accurate or make sense. If you make a mistake, you will literally _ see _ it
on the screen.

Here, the address you've given to [ gfx.Sprite ](gfx.Sprite_15958162.adoc) is
not the start of an image, but the start of your entire program. That means
what you see on the screen is the actual program itself. Crazy, right?

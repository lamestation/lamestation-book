In this chapter, you'll be introduced to the Spin programming language.

A computer is programmed by giving it instructions, one after the other, 

Once you've written a program, it is transformed into a form that a computer can read by a compiler. To run it, you have to download the code to the board in order to run it.

In PropellerIDE, simply press kbd:[F10] and in a few moments, the LameStation will run your code.

The examples in this section can be found in the `demos/basics/` folder of the LameStation SDK.

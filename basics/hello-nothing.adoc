PUB Main

Well, that was easy!

This is called a `PUB` block, which is short for _public function_ . Functions are areas where you write code that can _do stuff_. If your code is a sentence, a function is the verb, the action. You can put as many `PUB` blocks as you want into a file, but when you run your code, the Propeller will start by running the first public function that appears in the file. From that function, you can call other functions.

All Spin programs _must_ include a `PUB` block.

Spin is ** not ** case-sensitive.
    
    PUB Main

is the same as
    
    pub main

Remember that!
